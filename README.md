Frequency Scaler and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Frequency Scaler and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator. The design includes modules for scaling an input clock frequency and generating PWM signals based on a configurable duty cycle.

Features

Frequency Scaling: Adjusts the clock frequency to a lower value.

PWM Generation: Produces a PWM signal with a configurable duty cycle.

Verilog Implementation: Designed using Verilog HDL.

Testbenches Included: Verification of functionality using testbenches.
